    This Go package is a modified version of

        XZ Embedded  <http://tukaani.org/xz/embedded.html>

    The contents of the testdata directory are modified versions of
    the test files from

        XZ Utils  <http://tukaani.org/xz/>

    All the files in this package have been written by Michael Cross,
    Lasse Collin and/or Igor PavLov. All these files have been put
    into the public domain. You can do whatever you want with these
    files.

    This software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
